##StoryTelling With Data
#Overview
Police killings have become one of the top political and social issues in the United States. The present study
investigates the socioeconomic, demographic, and political factors that affect police killings across various
counties in the United States. Using a database of cases involving police killings, socioeconomic measures,
and Poisson regression analyses, we evaluate the influence of income, poverty, unemployment, education, state
political affiliation, armed status, and circumstances of death. The results establish significant disparities
in police-related deaths with specific regard to racial and economic factors, while political affiliation of the
states and whether the victim was armed emerged as two of the most powerful predictors. These results
further speak to the pressing need for structural reforms that alleviate inequalities and work to reduce police
killings going forward.
