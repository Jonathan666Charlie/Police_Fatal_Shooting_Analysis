My dataset has variables age (numeric), gender (binary), race (categorical), armed (binary) and shot (binary), 463 observations and 5 rows. What are some ideas of data visualization for EDA?

ChatGPT

Here are some data visualization ideas for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on your dataset with variables age, gender, race, armed, and shot:

### 1. **Univariate Visualizations**

1. **Age Distribution**  
   - **Histogram** or **Density Plot**: Show the distribution of age to identify patterns, outliers, or skewness.
   - **Box Plot**: Identify outliers and the spread of age.

2. **Gender Breakdown**  
   - **Bar Plot**: Visualize the count or percentage of each gender.

3. **Race Distribution**  
   - **Bar Plot**: Display the frequency of each race category.

4. **Armed Status**  
   - **Bar Plot**: Show the proportion of individuals who were armed versus unarmed.

5. **Shot Outcome**  
   - **Bar Plot**: Visualize the count or percentage of incidents where individuals were shot versus not shot.

### 2. **Bivariate Visualizations**

1. **Age vs. Shot Outcome**  
   - **Box Plot**: Compare the age distributions of individuals who were shot versus not shot.
   - **Violin Plot**: Similar to a box plot but also shows the density of data points.

2. **Gender vs. Shot Outcome**  
   - **Stacked Bar Plot** or **Grouped Bar Plot**: Show the proportion of shot outcomes for each gender.

3. **Race vs. Shot Outcome**  
   - **Stacked Bar Plot**: Compare shot outcomes across different races.

4. **Armed Status vs. Shot Outcome**  
   - **Bar Plot**: Show how often armed versus unarmed individuals were shot.

5. **Age by Armed Status**  
   - **Box Plot** or **Strip Plot**: Visualize differences in age between armed and unarmed individuals.

### 3. **Multivariate Visualizations**

1. **Age, Gender, and Shot Outcome**  
   - **Faceted Histograms**: Show age distributions for different genders and shot outcomes using small multiples.
   - **Scatter Plot**: If age can be plotted against other numeric data, color by gender and use different markers for shot outcomes.

2. **Race, Gender, and Shot Outcome**  
   - **Grouped Bar Plot with Race and Gender**: Show the breakdown of shot outcomes by both race and gender.

3. **Armed Status, Race, and Shot Outcome**  
   - **Stacked Bar Plot with Facets**: Display armed status by race, faceted by shot outcome.

---

### 4. **Interactive Visualizations (Using Plotly or Shiny)**

1. **Interactive Scatter Plot**  
   - Age vs. Shot outcome, with tooltips for gender, race, and armed status.

2. **Interactive Bar Chart**  
   - Allow filtering by race, gender, or armed status to dynamically display shot outcomes.

---

### 5. **Advanced Visualizations**

1. **Heatmap**  
   - Show correlations between numeric/binary variables, like age, armed, and shot.

2. **Mosaic Plot**  
   - Visualize the relationships between multiple categorical variables like gender, race, and shot.

These visualizations will help uncover patterns, trends, and potential biases in the data. Let me know if you'd like code examples for any of these!
